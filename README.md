## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Real-time Transit Information**: Provide the public with real-time transit information, including vehicle locations, predicted arrival times, and occupancy levels.
2. **Enhanced Efficiency**: Improve the efficiency of public transportation by optimizing routes and schedules based on data from IoT sensors.
3. **User Experience**: Enhance the overall user experience of public transportation services by reducing wait times and increasing transparency.

## System Components

The Public Transportation IoT Sensor Integration Project consists of the following key components:

1. **IoT Sensors**: These sensors are installed on public transportation vehicles and are responsible for collecting data on ridership, vehicle location, and other relevant information.

2. **Real-time Transit Information Platform**: This platform processes data from IoT sensors and makes it available to the public through a user-friendly interface. It also includes prediction algorithms for arrival times.

3. **Python Software**: Python is used for developing the software components of this project, including data processing, backend logic, and web-based interfaces.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
